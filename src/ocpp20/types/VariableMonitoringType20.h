Indicates that the Charging Station is unable to continue regular operations due to Hardware issues. Action is required. +

Indicates that the Charging Station is unable to continue regular operations due to software or minor hardware issues. Action is required. +

Indicates a non-urgent error. Action is required. +

Indicates an alert event. Default severity for any type of monitoring event.  +
*6-Warning* +
Indicates a warning event. Action may be required. +
*7-Notice* +
Indicates an unusual event. No immediate action is required. +

Indicates a regular operational event. May be used for reporting, measuring throughput, etc. No action is required. +
